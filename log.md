# 100 Days Of Code - Log Round 2



### Day 58 (July 25, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the blog project and the RESTful Routing section of the bootcamp. I hope to improve on it after learning some more and redo my portfoilio in Express. I also completed 1 "learnyounode" FCC challenge.

**Thoughts:** I had fun with this section. I think I am going to call it a day, though. It was a lot to take in, and I don't want to stress myself out. I will probably work through this section again and try to build something similar on my own.
