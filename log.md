# 100 Days Of Code - Log Round 2

### Day 14 (June 3, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Worked with the Giphy API on my React Local weather project. Made some progress with both. I'm just not sure if I like how the Giphy web app is coming along.

**Thoughts:** Feeling better today. I am going to rest for the rest of the day so I don't get stressed.

### Day 13 (June 2, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Not much progress today. Worked with some HTML and CSS. Set up a basic ReactJS project to start redoing my local weather app. I ran into a lot of issues, but eventually I got it working with some help.

**Thoughts:** Kind of stressed out about all of the issues I am having. Today was one of those "Maybe this isn't for me" days today.

### Days 1-12:

**Today's Progress**: Started to really learn Git. Deployed my first ReactJS project.

**Thoughts:** I was really stressed out up until today. After getting some help, things are making more sense. So far, this has been a good learning process. I feel kind of bad for not logging the first 11 days!
