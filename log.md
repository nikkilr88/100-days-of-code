### Day 28 (June 20, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Web Dev Bootcamp and lots of ReactJS today. Watched some tutorials and felt good enough to get a little work done on the recipe box project. I think I finally have my delete button working.

### Day 27 (June 19, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued "The Web Developer Bootcamp" & Codecademy "ReactJS: Part II".

**Thoughts:** Today has been better than the last few days. I'm trying to take it easy for a while and do lots of lessons and course work before continuing on with any big projects. Sometimes I push myself too much and lose motivation, so my focus is going to be on studying for a while.

### Day 26 (June 17, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Focused on ReactJS. Tried to get some work done on the recipe box project for FCC, but nothing seemed to click and I struggled a lot. With some help, I mananged to make a little progress and got the recipes on screen without DOM manipulation. I decided to quit while I was ahead.

**Thoughts:** It was a pretty stressful day. I know when I get like this I end up learning a lot, so I am going to try to be positive.

### Day 25 (June 16, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued "The Web Developer Bootcamp", worked a little with ReactJS and AngularJS.

**Thoughts:** I'm still not feeling very motivated. I don't feel like I am making any real progress.

### Day 24 (June 15, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued "The Web Developer Bootcamp". Started the JavaScript section and did a few assignments. Had a lot of problems with Git today. Almost lost somre projects. I also made a very basic admin login/logout system in PHP.

**Thoughts:** Kind of stressed because of Git. I figured everything out but ended up losing a lot motivation.

### Day 18 (June 8, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued with "The Web Developer Bootcamp" Udemy course and did a little work with React. Feels a bit slow, but I'm still learning things I didn't know before. I'm excited about the upcoming Bootstamp and JS sections!

### Day 17 (June 7, 2017):

### Day 16 (June 6, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Decided to take it easy today. Made a tabbed panel, watched tutorials on YouTube, worked on the Google homepage project for The Odin Project and did interactive ReactJS lessons.

### Day 15 (June 5, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Started doing The Odin Project again. I got a start on the Google homepage project. Learned how to do vertical positioning without flexbox. I'm also getting better with Git.

**Thoughts:** Feeling meh. Looked at one of my older projects in IE, and saw that flexbox wasn't working correctly even with the prefixes. It was kind of frustrating because I could not fix it. It might be a bug, though. I saw others with the same problem.

### Day 14 (June 3, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Worked with the Giphy API on my React Local weather project. Made some progress with both. I'm just not sure if I like how the Giphy web app is coming along.

**Thoughts:** Feeling better today. I am going to rest for the rest of the day so I don't get stressed.

### Day 13 (June 2, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Not much progress today. Worked with some HTML and CSS. Set up a basic ReactJS project to start redoing my local weather app. I ran into a lot of issues, but eventually I got it working with some help.

**Thoughts:** Kind of stressed out about all of the issues I am having. Today was one of those "Maybe this isn't for me" days today.

### Days 1-12:

**Today's Progress**: Started to really learn Git. Deployed my first ReactJS project.

**Thoughts:** I was really stressed out up until today. After getting some help, things are making more sense. So far, this has been a good learning process. I feel kind of bad for not logging the first 11 days!
