**Today's Progress**: Started redoing the JS calculator project, continued with the web dev course, and started refactoring my Tic Tac Toe game.

### Day 26 (June 17, 2017):

With some help, I mananged to make a little progress and got the recipes on screen without DOM manipulation. I decided to quit while I was ahead.

**Thoughts:** It was a pretty stressful day. I know when I get like this I end up learning a lot, so I am going to try to be positive.

**Today's Progress**: Started doing The Odin Project again. I got a start on the Google homepage project. Learned how to do vertical positioning without flexbox. I'm also getting better with Git.

**Thoughts:** Feeling meh. Looked at one of my older projects in IE, and saw that flexbox wasn't working correctly even with the prefixes. It was kind of frustrating because I could not fix it. It might be a bug, though. I saw others with the same problem.

### Day 14 (June 3, 2017):

**Thoughts:** Kind of stressed out about all of the issues I am having. Today was one of those "Maybe this isn't for me" days today.
