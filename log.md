# 100 Days Of Code - Log Round 2

### Day 23 (June 14, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued "The Web Developer Bootcamp". Finished the last Bootstrap project, so I'll finally be moving on to the JS section.

**Thoughts:** Got a late start today, but still got in a good amount of coding. I'm feeling like I need to be making more progress. We'll see...

### Days 19 & 20:

**Today's Progress**: Continued with "The Web Developer Bootcamp" Udemy course and worked a little on the Google homepage project.

**Thoughts:** Feeling positive. I really think I am going to learn a lot with this course.


### Day 18 (June 8, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued with "The Web Developer Bootcamp" Udemy course and did a little work with React. Feels a bit slow, but I'm still learning things I didn't know before. I'm excited about the upcoming Bootstamp and JS sections!

**Thoughts:** Had a good day. It will feel nice to get back to some bigger projects, though.

### Day 17 (June 7, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Giphy app. Added a "load more" button. Started "The Web Developer Bootcamp" Udemy course.

**Thoughts:** Feeling okay. Using C9 can still be stressfull, but I'm slowly getting the hang of it. I'm super excited about the course, though!

### Day 16 (June 6, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Decided to take it easy today. Made a tabbed panel, watched tutorials on YouTube, worked on the Google homepage project for The Odin Project and did interactive ReactJS lessons.

**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty good. It was nice to go back to the basics and just have some fun.

### Day 15 (June 5, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Started doing The Odin Project again. I got a start on the Google homepage project. Learned how to do vertical positioning without flexbox. I'm also getting better with Git.

**Thoughts:** Feeling meh. Looked at one of my older projects in IE, and saw that flexbox wasn't working correctly even with the prefixes. It was kind of frustrating because I could not fix it. It might be a bug, though. I saw others with the same problem.

### Day 14 (June 3, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Worked with the Giphy API on my React Local weather project. Made some progress with both. I'm just not sure if I like how the Giphy web app is coming along.

**Thoughts:** Feeling better today. I am going to rest for the rest of the day so I don't get stressed.

### Day 13 (June 2, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Not much progress today. Worked with some HTML and CSS. Set up a basic ReactJS project to start redoing my local weather app. I ran into a lot of issues, but eventually I got it working with some help.

**Thoughts:** Kind of stressed out about all of the issues I am having. Today was one of those "Maybe this isn't for me" days today.

### Days 1-12:

**Today's Progress**: Started to really learn Git. Deployed my first ReactJS project.

**Thoughts:** I was really stressed out up until today. After getting some help, things are making more sense. So far, this has been a good learning process. I feel kind of bad for not logging the first 11 days!
