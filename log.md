# 100 Days Of Code - Log Round 2

### Day 13 (June 2, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Not much progress today. Worked with some HTML and CSS. Set up a basic ReactJS project to start redoing my local weather app. I ran into a lot of issues, but eventually I got it working with some help.

**Thoughts:** Kind of stressed out about all of the issues I am having. Today was one of those "Maybe this isn't for me" days today.

### Days 1-12:

**Today's Progress**: Started to really learn Git. Deployed my first ReactJS project.

**Thoughts:** I was really stressed out up until today. After getting some help, things are making more sense. So far, this has been a good learning process. I feel kind of bad for not logging the first 11 days!
